R Code Script - MSc Independent Project Statistical Analysis

All .R files contain the script I created to carry out the data visualisation and statistical analysis of the data I collected for my MSc independent research project. I used R Studio to create the script and this linked to R which performed the analysis.

The title of each .R file relates to each hypothesis/test. Within each R.file there are non-coding notes denoted by '#' which I included to state the corresponding data (.txt) file, to explain what each code step does and to include some observational notes.

The .txt files contain the data if anyone wishes to run the code.

Permission to publish/share any 'findings' from this dataset is not granted as these may be submitted to a scientific journal for publication. Permission is needed from the owner. (Sorry - I have to put this line in).
